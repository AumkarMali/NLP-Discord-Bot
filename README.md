# NLP Discord Bot

Discord, one of the most widely used social media platforms, excels compared to others due to its use of programmable "bots" that can mimic user behavior and manage servers. The goal of this project was to create a single Discord bot capable of handling the commands typically managed by various other bots, such as MEE6 and SOFI. Most importantly, this bot should excel in user communication, making it indistinguishable from actual human profiles. The bot would be able to ask questions, make suggestions, and provide appropriate responses just like any other human would.
